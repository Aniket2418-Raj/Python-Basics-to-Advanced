soup.find('div', class_='content')

# CSS selectors
soup.select('.article-title')

# Attribute extraction
element.get('href')

# Text extraction with cleaning
element.get_text(strip=True)
```

### Robust Request Handling
```python
def get_page_safely(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```

### Data Validation
```python
def validate_scraped_data(data):
    required_fields = ['title', 'url', 'content']
    return all(field in data and data[field] for field in required_fields)
```

## 📊 Data Export Examples

### JSON Export
```python
import json

def save_to_json(data, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
```

### CSV Export
```python
import csv

def save_to_csv(data, filename):
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=data[0].keys())
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(data)
```

## ⚖️ Ethical Guidelines

### Always Remember
1. **Check robots.txt** before scraping any website
2. **Respect rate limits** - don't overwhelm servers
3. **Read terms of service** - understand legal restrictions
4. **Use APIs when available** - they're usually better than scraping
5. **Be respectful** - consider the impact on website owners

### Rate Limiting Example
```python
import time
import random

def respectful_delay():
    # Random delay between 1-3 seconds
    delay = random.uniform(1, 3)
    time.sleep(delay)
```

## 🔧 Error Handling Patterns

### Network Errors
```python
try:
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    print("Request timed out")
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
    print("Connection failed")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request failed: {e}")
```

### Parsing Errors
```python
def safe_extract(soup, selector, default="N/A"):
    try:
        element = soup.select_one(selector)
        return element.get_text(strip=True) if element else default
    except AttributeError:
        return default
```

## 📈 Performance Tips

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Reuse sessions** for multiple requests to the same domain
2. **Use connection pooling** for better performance
3. **Implement caching** to avoid redundant requests
4. **Process data in chunks** for large datasets
5. **Use generators** for memory-efficient processing

### Session Management
```python
session = requests.Session()
session.headers.update({'User-Agent': 'Your Bot Name'})

# Reuse session for multiple requests
response1 = session.get('https://example.com/page1')
response2 = session.get('https://example.com/page2')
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Problem: Getting Blocked
**Solutions:**
- Rotate user agents
- Use proxy servers
- Implement proper delays
- Respect robots.txt

### Problem: JavaScript-Heavy Sites
**Solutions:**
- Use Selenium for dynamic content
- Look for API endpoints
- Examine network traffic for data sources

### Problem: Inconsistent Data
**Solutions:**
- Implement robust validation
- Handle missing elements gracefully
- Create fallback extraction methods

## 🔍 Advanced Topics

### Dynamic Content Handling
For JavaScript-heavy websites, consider using Selenium:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://dynamic-site.com")
# Wait for content to load
content = driver.page_source
soup = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')
```

### Proxy Integration
```python
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://proxy-server:port',
    'https': 'https://proxy-server:port'
}
response = requests.get(url, proxies=proxies)
```
